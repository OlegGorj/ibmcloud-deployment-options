## Running `ibmcloud ks` commands from behind a firewall
{: #firewall_bx}

If corporate network policies prevent access from your local system to public endpoints via proxies or firewalls, to run `ibmcloud ks` commands, you must allow TCP access for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}

1. Allow access to `containers.bluemix.net` on port 443.
2. Verify your connection. If access is configured correctly, ships are displayed in the output.
   ```
   curl https://containers.bluemix.net/v1/
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
                                     )___(
                              _______/__/_
                     ___     /===========|   ___
    ____       __   [\\\]___/____________|__[///]   __
    \   \_____[\\]__/___________________________\__[//]___
     \                                                    |
      \                                                  /
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   ```

<br />


## Running `kubectl` commands from behind a firewall
{: #firewall_kubectl}

If corporate network policies prevent access from your local system to public endpoints via proxies or firewalls, to run `kubectl` commands, you must allow TCP access for the cluster.
{:shortdesc}

When a cluster is created, the port in the master URL is randomly assigned from within 20000-32767. You can either choose to open port range 20000-32767 for any cluster that might get created or you can choose to allow access for a specific existing cluster.

Before you begin, allow access to [run `ibmcloud ks` commands](#firewall_bx).

To allow access for a specific cluster:

1. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. Enter your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} credentials when prompted. If you have a federated account, include the `--sso` option.

   ```
   ibmcloud login [--sso]
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Select the region that your cluster is in.

   ```
   ibmcloud ks region-set
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Get the name of your cluster.

   ```
   ibmcloud ks clusters
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Retrieve the **Master URL** for your cluster.

   ```
   ibmcloud ks cluster-get <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   ...
   Master URL:		https://169.xx.xxx.xxx:31142
   ...
   ```
   {: screen}

5. Allow access to the **Master URL** on the port, such as port `31142` from the previous example.

6. Verify your connection.

   ```
   curl --insecure <master_URL>/version
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example command:
   ```
   curl --insecure https://169.xx.xxx.xxx:31142/version
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   {
     "major": "1",
     "minor": "7+",
     "gitVersion": "v1.7.4-2+eb9172c211dc41",
     "gitCommit": "eb9172c211dc4108341c0fd5340ee5200f0ec534",
     "gitTreeState": "clean",
     "buildDate": "2017-11-16T08:13:08Z",
     "goVersion": "go1.8.3",
     "compiler": "gc",
     "platform": "linux/amd64"
   }
   ```
   {: screen}

7. Optional: Repeat these steps for each cluster that you need to expose.

<br />


## Running `calicoctl` commands from behind a firewall
{: #firewall_calicoctl}

If corporate network policies prevent access from your local system to public endpoints via proxies or firewalls, to run `calicoctl` commands, you must allow TCP access for the Calico commands.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin, allow access to run [`ibmcloud` commands](#firewall_bx) and [`kubectl` commands](#firewall_kubectl).

1. Retrieve the IP address from the master URL that you used to allow the [`kubectl` commands](#firewall_kubectl).

2. Get the port for ETCD.

  ```
  kubectl get cm -n kube-system calico-config -o yaml | grep etcd_endpoints
  ```
  {: pre}

3. Allow access for the Calico policies via the master URL IP address and the ETCD port.

<br />


## Allowing the cluster to access infrastructure resources and other services
{: #firewall_outbound}

Let your cluster access infrastructure resources and services from behind a firewall, such as for {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} regions, {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}}, IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) private IPs, and egress for persistent volume claims.
{:shortdesc}

  1.  Note the public IP address for all of your worker nodes in the cluster.

      ```
      ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_ID>
      ```
      {: pre}

  2.  Allow outgoing network traffic from the source _<each_worker_node_publicIP>_ to the destination TCP/UDP port range 20000-32767 and port 443, and the following IP addresses and network groups. If you have a corporate firewall that prevents your local machine from accessing public internet endpoints, do this step for both your source worker nodes and your local machine.
      - **Important**: You must allow outgoing traffic to port 443 for all of the zones within the region, to balance the load during the bootstrapping process. For example, if your cluster is in US South, you must allow traffic from port 443 to the IP addresses for all of the zones (dal10, dal12, and dal13).

  3.  Allow outgoing network traffic from the worker nodes to [{{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} regions](/docs/services/Registry/registry_overview.html#registry_regions):
      - `TCP port 443 FROM <each_worker_node_publicIP> TO <registry_publicIP>`
      - Replace <em>&lt;registry_publicIP&gt;</em> with the registry IP addresses to which you want to allow traffic. The global registry stores IBM-provided public images, and regional registries store your own private or public images.

  5. For private firewalls, allow the appropriate IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) private IP ranges. Consult [this link](/docs/infrastructure/hardware-firewall-dedicated/ips.html#backend-private-network) beginning with the **Backend (private) Network** section.
      - Add all of the [zones within the regions](cs_regions.html#zones) that you are using.
      - Note that you must add the `dal01` zone (data center).
      - Open ports 80 and 443 to allow the cluster bootstrapping process.
      - Open port 10250 for the Kubernetes dashboard.
      - Open port 53 for DNS access.
      - Because all pod-to-pod traffic goes over the private network, either open all ports that the pods are using to communicate, or open all ports for the worker nodes in the cluster.

  6. {: #pvc}To create persistent volume claims for data storage, allow egress access through your firewall for the [IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) IP addresses](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/faq/what-ip-ranges-do-i-allow-through-firewall) of the zone that your cluster is in.
      - To find the zone of your cluster, run `ibmcloud ks clusters`.
      - Allow access to the IP range for both the **Frontend (public) network** and **Backend (private) Network**.
      - Note that you must add the `dal01` zone (data center) for the **Backend (private) Network**.

## Accessing NodePort, load balancer, and Ingress services from outside the cluster
{: #firewall_inbound}

You can allow incoming access to NodePort, load balancer, and Ingress services.
{:shortdesc}

<dl>
  <dt>NodePort service</dt>
  <dd>Open the port that you configured when you deployed the service to the public IP addresses for all of the worker nodes to allow traffic to. To find the port, run `kubectl get svc`. The port is in the 20000-32000 range.<dd>
  <dt>LoadBalancer service</dt>
  <dd>Open the port that you configured when you deployed the service to the load balancer service's public IP address.</dd>
  <dt>Ingress</dt>
  <dd>Open port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS to the IP address for the Ingress application load balancer.</dd>
</dl>
