# Exposing apps with Ingress
{: #ingress}

Expose multiple apps in your Kubernetes cluster by creating Ingress resources that are managed by the IBM-provided application load balancer in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
{:shortdesc}

## Ingress components and architecture
{: #planning}

Ingress is a Kubernetes service that balances network traffic workloads in your cluster by forwarding public or private requests to your apps. You can use Ingress to expose multiple app services to the public or to a private network by using a unique public or private route.
{:shortdesc}

**What comes with Ingress?**</br>
Ingress consists of three components:
<dl>
<dt>Ingress resource</dt>
<dd>To expose an app by using Ingress, you must create a Kubernetes service for your app and register this service with Ingress by defining an Ingress resource. The Ingress resource is a Kubernetes resource that defines the rules for how to route incoming requests for apps. The Ingress resource also specifies the path to your app services, which are appended to the public route to form a unique app URL such as `mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp1`. <br></br>**Note**: As of 24 May 2018, the Ingress subdomain format changed for new clusters. The region or zone name included in the new subdomain format is generated based on the zone where the cluster was created. If you have pipeline dependencies on consistent app domain names, you can use your own custom domain instead of the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain.<ul><li>All clusters created after 24 May 2018 are assigned a subdomain in the new format, <code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;.&lt;region_or_zone&gt;.containers.appdomain.cloud</code>.</li><li>Single-zone clusters created before 24 May 2018 continue to use the assigned subdomain in the old format, <code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.containers.mybluemix.net</code>.</li><li>If you change a single-zone cluster created before 24 May 2018 to multizone by [adding a zone to the cluster](cs_clusters.html#add_zone) for the first time, the cluster continues to use the assigned subdomain in the old format, <code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.containers.mybluemix.net</code>, and is also assigned a subdomain in the new format, <code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;.&lt;region_or_zone&gt;.containers.appdomain.cloud</code>. Either subdomain can be used.</li></ul></br>**Multizone clusters**: The Ingress resource is global, and only one Ingress resource is required per namespace for a multizone cluster.</dd>
<dt>Application load balancer (ALB)</dt>
<dd>The application load balancer (ALB) is an external load balancer that listens for incoming HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, or UDP service requests. The ALB then forwards requests to the appropriate app pod according to the rules defined in the Ingress resource. When you create a standard cluster, {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} automatically creates a highly available ALB for your cluster and assigns a unique public route to it. The public route is linked to a portable public IP address that is provisioned into your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account during cluster creation. A default private ALB is also automatically created, but is not automatically enabled.<br></br>**Multizone clusters**: When you add a zone to your cluster, a portable public subnet is added, and a new public ALB is automatically created and enabled on the subnet in that zone. All default public ALBs in your cluster share one public route, but have a different IP addresses. A default private ALB is also automatically created in each zone, but is not automatically enabled.</dd>
<dt>Multizone load balancer (MZLB)</dt>
<dd><p>**Multizone clusters**: Whenever you change a cluster from single- to multizone by [adding a zone to the cluster](cs_clusters.html#add_zone) for the first time, a multizone load balancer (MZLB) is automatically created and deployed to each zone where you have workers. The MZLB health checks the ALBs in each zone of your cluster and keeps the DNS lookup results updated based on these health checks. For example, if your ALBs have IP addresses `1.1.1.1`, `2.2.2.2`, and `3.3.3.3`, a normal operation DNS lookup of your Ingress Subdomain returns all 3 IPs, 1 of which the client accesses at random. If the ALB with IP address `3.3.3.3` becomes unavailable for any reason, the MZLB health check fails, the DNS lookup returns the available `1.1.1.1` and `2.2.2.2` ALB IPs, and the client accesses one of the available ALB IPs.</p>
<p>The MZLB load balances for public ALBs that use the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain only. If you use only private ALBs, you must manually check the health of the ALBs and update DNS lookup results. If you use public ALBs that use a custom domain, you can include the ALBs in MZLB load balancing by creating a CNAME in your DNS entry to forward requests from your custom domain to the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain for your cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you use Calico pre-DNAT network policies to block all incoming traffic to Ingress services, you must also whitelist <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/">Cloudflare's IPv4 IPs <img src="../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> that are used to check the health of your ALBs. For steps on how to create a Calico pre-DNAT policy to whitelist these IPs, see Lesson 3 of the <a href="cs_tutorials_policies.html#lesson3">Calico network policy tutorial</a>.</dd>
</dl>

**How does a request get to my app with Ingress in a single zone cluster?**</br>
The following diagram shows how Ingress directs communication from the internet to an app in a single-zone cluster:

<img src="images/cs_ingress_singlezone.png" alt="Expose an app in a single-zone cluster by using Ingress" style="border-style: none"/>

1. A user sends a request to your app by accessing your app's URL. This URL is the public URL for your exposed app appended with the Ingress resource path, such as `mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp`.

2. A DNS system service resolves the hostname in the URL to the portable public IP address of the load balancer that exposes the ALB in your cluster.

3. Based on the resolved IP address, the client sends the request to the load balancer service that exposes the ALB.

4. The load balancer service routes the request to the ALB.

5. The ALB checks if a routing rule for the `myapp` path in the cluster exists. If a matching rule is found, the request is forwarded according to the rules that you defined in the Ingress resource to the pod where the app is deployed. The source IP address of the package is changed to the IP address of the public IP address of the worker node where the app pod is running. If multiple app instances are deployed in the cluster, the ALB load balances the requests between the app pods.

**How does a request get to my app with Ingress in a multizone cluster?**</br>
The following diagram shows how Ingress directs communication from the internet to an app in a multizone cluster:

<img src="images/cs_ingress_multizone.png" alt="Expose an app in a multizone cluster by using Ingress" style="border-style: none"/>

1. A user sends a request to your app by accessing your app's URL. This URL is the public URL for your exposed app appended with the Ingress resource path, such as `mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp`.

2. A DNS system service, which acts as the global load balancer, resolves the hostname in the URL to an available IP address that was reported as healthy by the MZLB. The MZLB continuously checks the portable public IP addresses of the load balancer services that expose public ALBs in your cluster. The IP addresses are resolved in a round-robin cycle, ensuring that requests are equally load balanced among the healthy ALBs in various zones.

3. The client sends the request to the IP address of the load balancer service that exposes an ALB.

4. The load balancer service routes the request to the ALB.

5. The ALB checks if a routing rule for the `myapp` path in the cluster exists. If a matching rule is found, the request is forwarded according to the rules that you defined in the Ingress resource to the pod where the app is deployed. The source IP address of the package is changed to the IP address of the public IP address of the worker node where the app pod is running. If multiple app instances are deployed in the cluster, the ALB load balances the requests between app pods across all zones.

<br />


## Prerequisites
{: #config_prereqs}

Before you get started with Ingress, review the following prerequisites.
{:shortdesc}

**Prerequisites for all Ingress configurations:**
- Ingress is available for standard clusters only and requires at least two worker nodes per zone to ensure high availability and that periodic updates are applied.
- Setting up Ingress requires an [Administrator access policy](cs_users.html#access_policies). Verify your current [access policy](cs_users.html#infra_access).

**Prerequisites for using Ingress in multizone clusters**:
 - If you restrict network traffic to [edge worker nodes](cs_edge.html), at least 2 edge worker nodes must be enabled in each zone for high availability of Ingress pods. [Create an edge node worker pool](cs_clusters.html#add_pool) that spans all the zones in your cluster and has at least 2 worker nodes per zone.
 - To enable communication on the private network between workers that are in different zones, you must enable [VLAN spanning](/docs/infrastructure/vlans/vlan-spanning.html#vlan-spanning).
 - If a zone fails, you might see intermittent failures in requests to the Ingress ALB in that zone.

<br />


## Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces
{: #multiple_namespaces}

At least one Ingress resource is required per namespace where you have apps that you want to expose.
{:shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>All apps are in one namespace</dt>
<dd>If the apps in your cluster are all in the same namespace, at least one Ingress resource is required to define routing rules for the apps that are exposed there. For example, if you have `app1` and `app2` exposed by services in a development namespace, you can create an Ingress resource in the namespace. The resource specifies `domain.net` as the host and registers the paths that each app listens on with `domain.net`.
<br></br><img src="images/cs_ingress_single_ns.png" width="300" alt="At least one resource is required per namespace." style="width:300px; border-style: none"/>
</dd>
<dt>Apps are in multiple namespaces</dt>
<dd>If the apps in your cluster are in different namespaces, you must create at least one resource per namespace to define rules for the apps that are exposed there. To register multiple Ingress resources with the cluster's Ingress ALB, you must use a wildcard domain. When a wildcard domain such as `*.domain.net` is registered, multiple subdomains all resolve to the same host. Then, you can create an Ingress resource in each namespace and specify a different subdomain in each Ingress resource.
<br><br>
For example, consider the following scenario:<ul>
<li>You have two versions of the same app, `app1` and `app3`, for testing purposes.</li>
<li>You deploy the apps in two different namespaces within the same cluster: `app1` into the development namespace, and `app3` into the staging namespace.</li></ul>
To use the same cluster ALB to manage traffic to these apps, you create the following services and resources:<ul>
<li>A Kubernetes service in the development namespace to expose `app1`.</li>
<li>An Ingress resource in the development namespace that specifies the host as `dev.domain.net`.</li>
<li>A Kubernetes service in the staging namespace to expose `app3`.</li>
<li>An Ingress resource in the staging namespace that specifies the host as `stage.domain.net`.</li></ul></br>
<img src="images/cs_ingress_multi_ns.png" alt="Within a namespace, use subdomains in one or multiple resources" style="border-style: none"/>
Now, both URLs resolve to the same domain and are thus both serviced by the same ALB. However, because the resource in the staging namespace is registered with the `stage` subdomain, the Ingress ALB correctly routes requests from the `stage.domain.net/app3` URL to only `app3`.</dd>
</dl>

{: #wildcard_tls}
**Note**:
* The IBM-provided Ingress subdomain wildcard, `*.<cluster_name>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`, is registered by default for your cluster. For clusters created on or after 6 June 2018, the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain TLS certificate is a wildcard certificate and can be used for the registered wildcard subdomain. For clusters created before 6 June, 2018, TLS certificate will be updated to a wildcard certificate when the current TLS certificate is renewed.
* If you want to use a custom domain, you must register the custom domain as a wildcard domain such as `*.custom_domain.net`. To use TLS, you must get a wildcard certificate.

### Multiple domains within a namespace

Within an individual namespace, you can use one domain to access all the apps in the namespace. If you want to use different domains for the apps within an individual namespace, use a wildcard domain. When a wildcard domain such as `*.mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud` is registered, multiple subdomains all resolve to the same host. Then, you can use one resource to specify multiple subdomain hosts within that resource. Alternatively, you can create multiple Ingress resources in the namespace and specify a different subdomain in each Ingress resource.

<img src="images/cs_ingress_single_ns_multi_subs.png" alt="At least one resource is required per namespace." style="border-style: none"/>

**Note**:
* The IBM-provided Ingress subdomain wildcard, `*.<cluster_name>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`, is registered by default for your cluster. For clusters created on or after 6 June 2018, the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain TLS certificate is a wildcard certificate and can be used for the registered wildcard subdomain. For clusters created before 6 June 2018, TLS certificate will be updated to a wildcard certificate when the current TLS certificate is renewed.
* If you want to use a custom domain, you must register the custom domain as a wildcard domain such as `*.custom_domain.net`. To use TLS, you must get a wildcard certificate.

## Exposing apps that are inside your cluster to the public
{: #ingress_expose_public}

Expose apps that are inside your cluster to the public by using the public Ingress ALB.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster to run `kubectl` commands.

### Step 1: Deploy apps and create app services
{: #public_inside_1}

Start by deploying your apps and creating Kubernetes services to expose them.
{: shortdesc}

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli). Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file, such as `app: code`. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app is running so that the pods can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

2.   Create a Kubernetes service for each app that you want to expose. Your app must be exposed by a Kubernetes service to be included by the cluster ALB in the Ingress load balancing.
      1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myappservice.yaml`.
      2.  Define a service for the app that the ALB will expose.

          ```
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: myappservice
          spec:
            selector:
              <selector_key>: <selector_value>
            ports:
             - protocol: TCP
               port: 8080
          ```
          {: codeblock}

          <table>
          <thead>
          <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the ALB service YAML file components</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          <tr>
          <td><code>selector</code></td>
          <td>Enter the label key (<em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em>) and value (<em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em>) pair that you want to use to target the pods where your app runs. To target your pods and include them in the service load balancing, ensure that the <em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em> are the same as the key/value pair in the <code>spec.template.metadata.labels</code> section of your deployment yaml.</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
           <td><code>port</code></td>
           <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
           </tr>
           </tbody></table>
      3.  Save your changes.
      4.  Create the service in your cluster. If apps are deployed in multiple namespaces in your cluster, ensure that the service deploys into the same namespace as the app that you want to expose.

          ```
          kubectl apply -f myappservice.yaml [-n <namespace>]
          ```
          {: pre}
      5.  Repeat these steps for every app that you want to expose.


### Step 2: Select an app domain and TLS termination
{: #public_inside_2}

When you configure the public ALB, you choose the domain that your apps will be accessible through and whether to use TLS termination.
{: shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>Domain</dt>
<dd>You can use the IBM-provided domain, such as <code>mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp</code>, to access your app from the internet. To use a custom domain instead, you can set up a CNAME record to map your custom domain to the IBM-provided domain or set up an A record with your DNS provider using the ALB's public IP address.</dd>
<dt>TLS termination</dt>
<dd>The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to the apps in your cluster. To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to decrypt the network traffic and forward the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster. <ul><li>If you use the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain, you can use the IBM-provided TLS certificate. IBM-provided TLS certificates are signed by LetsEncrypt and are fully managed by IBM. The certificates expire every 90 days and are automatically renewed 7 days before they expire.</li><li>If you use a custom domain, you can use your own TLS certificate to manage TLS termination. If you have apps in one namespace only, you can import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in that same namespace. If you have apps in multiple namespaces, import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in the <code>default</code> namespace so that the ALB can access and use the certificate in every namespace.</li></ul></dd>
</dl>

To use the IBM-provided Ingress domain:
1. Get the details for your cluster. Replace _&lt;cluster_name_or_ID&gt;_ with the name of the cluster where the apps that you want to expose are deployed.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster-get <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    Name:                   mycluster
    ID:                     18a61a63c6a94b658596ca93d087aad9
    State:                  normal
    Created:                2018-01-12T18:33:35+0000
    Zone:                   dal10
    Master URL:             https://169.xx.xxx.xxx:26268
    Ingress Subdomain:      mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
    Ingress Secret:         <tls_secret>
    Workers:                3
    Version:                1.10.5
    Owner Email:            owner@email.com
    Monitoring Dashboard:   <dashboard_URL>
    ```
    {: screen}
2. Get the IBM-provided domain in the **Ingress subdomain** field. If you want to use TLS, also get the IBM-provided TLS secret in the **Ingress Secret** field.
    **Note**: For information about wildcard TLS certification, see [this note](#wildcard_tls).

To use a custom domain:
1.    Create a custom domain. To register your custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider or [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} DNS](/docs/infrastructure/dns/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-dns).
      * If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`.

2.  Configure your domain to route incoming network traffic to the IBM-provided ALB. Choose between these options:
    -   Define an alias for your custom domain by specifying the IBM-provided domain as a Canonical Name record (CNAME). To find the IBM-provided Ingress domain, run `ibmcloud ks cluster-get <cluster_name>` and look for the **Ingress subdomain** field.
    -   Map your custom domain to the portable public IP address of the IBM-provided ALB by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable public IP address of the ALB, run `ibmcloud ks alb-get <public_alb_ID>`.
3.   Optional: To use TLS, either import or create a TLS certificate and key secret. If you use a wildcard domain, ensure that you import or create a wildcard certificate in the <code>default</code> namespace so that the ALB can access and use the certificate in each namespace.
      * If a TLS certificate is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:
        ```
        ibmcloud ks alb-cert-deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
        ```
        {: pre}
      * If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
        1. Create a TLS certificate and key for your domain that is encoded in PEM format.
        2. Create a secret that uses your TLS certificate and key. Replace <em>&lt;tls_secret_name&gt;</em> with a name for your Kubernetes secret, <em>&lt;tls_key_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS key file, and <em>&lt;tls_cert_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS certificate file.
          ```
          kubectl create secret tls <tls_secret_name> --key=<tls_key_filepath> --cert=<tls_cert_filepath>
          ```
          {: pre}


### Step 3: Create the Ingress resource
{: #public_inside_3}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

**Note:** If your cluster has multiple namespaces where apps are exposed, at least one Ingress resource is required per namespace. However, each namespace must use a different host. You must register a wildcard domain and specify a different subdomain in each resource. For more information, see [Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces](#multiple_namespaces).

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingressresource.yaml`.

2. Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses the IBM-provided domain or your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example YAML that uses TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <tls_secret_name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```

## Exposing apps that are outside your cluster to the public
{: #external_endpoint}

Expose apps that are outside your cluster to the public by including them in public Ingress ALB load balancing. Incoming public requests on the IBM-provided or your custom domain are forwarded automatically to the external app.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

-   Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
-   Ensure that the external app that you want to include into the cluster load balancing can be accessed by using a public IP address.
-   [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster to run `kubectl` commands.

### Step 1: Create an app service and external endpoint
{: #public_outside_1}

Start by creating a Kubernetes service to expose the external app and configuring a Kubernetes external endpoint for the app.
{: shortdesc}

1.  Create a Kubernetes service for your cluster that will forward incoming requests to an external endpoint that you will create.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalservice.yaml`.
    2.  Define a service for the app that the ALB will expose.

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: myexternalservice
        spec:
          ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 8080
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        <table>

        <thead>
        <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the YAML file components</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><code>metadata/name</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myexternalservice&gt;</em> with a name for your service.<p>Learn more about [securing your personal information](cs_secure.html#pi) when you work with Kubernetes resources.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>port</code></td>
        <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
        </tr></tbody></table>

    3.  Save your changes.
    4.  Create the Kubernetes service for your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myexternalservice.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}
2.  Configure a Kubernetes endpoint that defines the external location of the app that you want to include into the cluster load balancing.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create an endpoint configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalendpoint.yaml`.
    2.  Define your external endpoint. Include all public IP addresses and ports that you can use to access your external app.

        ```
        kind: Endpoints
        apiVersion: v1
        metadata:
          name: myexternalendpoint
        subsets:
          - addresses:
              - ip: <external_IP1>
              - ip: <external_IP2>
            ports:
              - port: <external_port>
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        <table>
        <thead>
        <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the YAML file components</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><code>name</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myexternalendpoint&gt;</em> with the name of the Kubernetes service that you created earlier.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>ip</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;external_IP&gt;</em> with the public IP addresses to connect to your external app.</td>
         </tr>
         <td><code>port</code></td>
         <td>Replace <em>&lt;external_port&gt;</em> with the port that your external app listens to.</td>
         </tbody></table>

    3.  Save your changes.
    4.  Create the Kubernetes endpoint for your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myexternalendpoint.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

### Step 2: Select an app domain and TLS termination
{: #public_outside_2}

When you configure the public ALB, you choose the domain that your apps will be accessible through and whether to use TLS termination.
{: shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>Domain</dt>
<dd>You can use the IBM-provided domain, such as <code>mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp</code>, to access your app from the internet. To use a custom domain instead, you can set up a CNAME record to map your custom domain to the IBM-provided domain or set up an A record with your DNS provider using the ALB's public IP address.</dd>
<dt>TLS termination</dt>
<dd>The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to the apps in your cluster. To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to decrypt the network traffic and forward the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster. <ul><li>If you use the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain, you can use the IBM-provided TLS certificate. IBM-provided TLS certificates are signed by LetsEncrypt and are fully managed by IBM. The certificates expire every 90 days and are automatically renewed 7 days before they expire.</li><li>If you use a custom domain, you can use your own TLS certificate to manage TLS termination. If you have apps in one namespace only, you can import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in that same namespace. If you have apps in multiple namespaces, import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in the <code>default</code> namespace so that the ALB can access and use the certificate in every namespace.</li></ul></dd>
</dl>

To use the IBM-provided Ingress domain:
1. Get the details for your cluster. Replace _&lt;cluster_name_or_ID&gt;_ with the name of the cluster where the apps that you want to expose are deployed.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster-get <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    Name:                   mycluster
    ID:                     18a61a63c6a94b658596ca93d087aad9
    State:                  normal
    Created:                2018-01-12T18:33:35+0000
    Zone:                   dal10
    Master URL:             https://169.xx.xxx.xxx:26268
    Ingress Subdomain:      mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
    Ingress Secret:         <tls_secret>
    Workers:                3
    Version:                1.10.5
    Owner Email:            owner@email.com
    Monitoring Dashboard:   <dashboard_URL>
    ```
    {: screen}
2. Get the IBM-provided domain in the **Ingress subdomain** field. If you want to use TLS, also get the IBM-provided TLS secret in the **Ingress Secret** field. **Note**: For information about wildcard TLS certification, see [this note](#wildcard_tls).

To use a custom domain:
1.    Create a custom domain. To register your custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider or [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} DNS](/docs/infrastructure/dns/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-dns).
      * If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`.

2.  Configure your domain to route incoming network traffic to the IBM-provided ALB. Choose between these options:
    -   Define an alias for your custom domain by specifying the IBM-provided domain as a Canonical Name record (CNAME). To find the IBM-provided Ingress domain, run `ibmcloud ks cluster-get <cluster_name>` and look for the **Ingress subdomain** field.
    -   Map your custom domain to the portable public IP address of the IBM-provided ALB by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable public IP address of the ALB, run `ibmcloud ks alb-get <public_alb_ID>`.
3.   Optional: To use TLS, either import or create a TLS certificate and key secret. If you use a wildcard domain, ensure that you import or create a wildcard certificate in the <code>default</code> namespace so that the ALB can access and use the certificate in each namespace.
      * If a TLS certificate is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:
        ```
        ibmcloud ks alb-cert-deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
        ```
        {: pre}
      * If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
        1. Create a TLS certificate and key for your domain that is encoded in PEM format.
        2. Create a secret that uses your TLS certificate and key. Replace <em>&lt;tls_secret_name&gt;</em> with a name for your Kubernetes secret, <em>&lt;tls_key_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS key file, and <em>&lt;tls_cert_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS certificate file.
          ```
          kubectl create secret tls <tls_secret_name> --key=<tls_key_filepath> --cert=<tls_cert_filepath>
          ```
          {: pre}


### Step 3: Create the Ingress resource
{: #public_outside_3}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

**Note:** If you are exposing multiple external apps, and the services you created for the apps in [Step 1](#public_outside_1) are in different namespaces, at least one Ingress resource is required per namespace. However, each namespace must use a different host. You must register a wildcard domain and specify a different subdomain in each resource. For more information, see [Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces](#multiple_namespaces).

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalingress.yaml`.

2. Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses the IBM-provided domain or your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myexternalingress
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<external_app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<external_app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example YAML that uses TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myexternalingress
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <tls_secret_name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<external_app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<external_app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80

## Enabling a default private ALB
{: #private_ingress}

When you create a standard cluster, an IBM-provided private application load balancer (ALB) is created in each zone that you have worker nodes and assigned a portable private IP address and a private route. However, the default private ALB in each zone is not automatically enabled. To use the default private ALB to load balance private network traffic to your apps, you must first enable it with either the IBM-provided portable private IP address or your own portable private IP address.
{:shortdesc}

**Note**: If you used the `--no-subnet` flag when you created the cluster, then you must add a portable private subnet or a user-managed subnet before you can enable the private ALB. For more information, see [Requesting more subnets for your cluster](cs_subnets.html#request).

Before you begin:

-   Review the options for planning private access to apps when worker nodes are connected to [a public and a private VLAN](cs_network_planning.html#private_both_vlans) or to [a private VLAN only](cs_network_planning.html#private_vlan).
-   [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster.

To enable a default private ALB by using the pre-assigned, IBM-provided portable private IP address:

1. Get the ID of the default private ALB that you want to enable. Replace <em>&lt;cluster_name&gt;</em> with the name of the cluster where the app that you want to expose is deployed.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks albs --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    The field **Status** for private ALBs is _disabled_.
    ```
    ALB ID                                            Enabled   Status     Type      ALB IP          Zone
    private-cr6d779503319d419aa3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1   false     disabled   private   -               dal10
    private-crb2f60e9735254ac8b20b9c1e38b649a5-alb2   false     disabled   private   -               dal12
    public-cr6d779503319d419aa3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1    true      enabled    public    169.xx.xxx.xxx  dal10
    public-crb2f60e9735254ac8b20b9c1e38b649a5-alb2    true      enabled    public    169.xx.xxx.xxx  dal12
    ```
    {: screen}
    In multizone clusters, the numbered suffix on the ALB ID indicates the order that the ALB was added.
    * For example, the `-alb1` suffix on the ALB `private-cr6d779503319d419aa3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1` indicates that it was the first default private ALB that was created. It exists in the zone where you created the cluster. In the above example, the cluster was created in `dal10`.
    * The `-alb2` suffix on the ALB `private-crb2f60e9735254ac8b20b9c1e38b649a5-alb2` indicates that it was the second default private ALB that was created. It exists in the second zone that you added to your cluster. In the above example, the second zone is `dal12`.

2. Enable the private ALB. Replace <em>&lt;private_ALB_ID&gt;</em> with the ID for private ALB from the output in the previous step.

   ```
   ibmcloud ks alb-configure --albID <private_ALB_ID> --enable
   ```
   {: pre}

<br>
To enable the private ALB by using your own portable private IP address:

1. Configure the user-managed subnet of your chosen IP address to route traffic on the private VLAN of your cluster.

   ```
   ibmcloud ks cluster-user-subnet-add <cluster_name> <subnet_CIDR> <private_VLAN_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

   <table>

   <td>The name or ID of the cluster where the app that you want to expose is deployed.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><code>&lt;subnet_CIDR&gt;</code></td>
   <td>The CIDR of your user-managed subnet.</td>

   <td><code>&lt;private_VLAN_ID&gt;</code></td>
   <td>An available private VLAN ID. You can find the ID of an available private VLAN by running `ibmcloud ks vlans`.</td>
   </tr>
   </tbody></table>

2. List the available ALBs in your cluster to get the ID of private ALB.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks albs --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    The field **Status** for the private ALB is _disabled_.
    ```

    ```
    {: screen}

3. Enable the private ALB. Replace <em>&lt;private_ALB_ID&gt;</em> with the ID for private ALB from the output in the previous step and <em>&lt;user_IP&gt;</em> with the IP address from your user-managed subnet that you want to use.

   ```
   ibmcloud ks alb-configure --albID <private_ALB_ID> --enable --user-ip <user_IP>

## Exposing apps to a private network
{: #ingress_expose_private}

Expose apps to a private network by using the private Ingress ALB.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:
* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* Review the options for planning private access to apps when worker nodes are connected to [a public and a private VLAN](cs_network_planning.html#private_both_vlans) or to [a private VLAN only](cs_network_planning.html#private_vlan).
    * Public and private VLAN: To use the default external DNS provider, you must [configure edge nodes with public access](cs_edge.html#edge) and [configure a Virtual Router Appliance ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/07/kubernetes-and-bluemix-container-based-workloads-part4/).
    * Private VLAN only: You must configure a [DNS service that is available on the private network ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/).
* [Enable the private application load balancer](#private_ingress).

### Step 1: Deploy apps and create app services
{: #private_1}

Start by deploying your apps and creating Kubernetes services to expose them.
{: shortdesc}

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli). Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file, such as `app: code`. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app is running so that the pods can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

2.   Create a Kubernetes service for each app that you want to expose. Your app must be exposed by a Kubernetes service to be included by the cluster ALB in the Ingress load balancing.
      1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myappservice.yaml`.
      2.  Define a service for the app that the ALB will expose.

          ```
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: myappservice
          spec:
            selector:
              <selector_key>: <selector_value>
            ports:
             - protocol: TCP
               port: 8080
          ```
          {: codeblock}

          <table>
          <thead>
          <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the ALB service YAML file components</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          <tr>
          <td><code>selector</code></td>
          <td>Enter the label key (<em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em>) and value (<em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em>) pair that you want to use to target the pods where your app runs. To target your pods and include them in the service load balancing, ensure that the <em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em> are the same as the key/value pair in the <code>spec.template.metadata.labels</code> section of your deployment yaml.</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
           <td><code>port</code></td>
           <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
           </tr>
           </tbody></table>
      3.  Save your changes.
      4.  Create the service in your cluster. If apps are deployed in multiple namespaces in your cluster, ensure that the service deploys into the same namespace as the app that you want to expose.

          ```
          kubectl apply -f myappservice.yaml [-n <namespace>]
          ```
          {: pre}
      5.  Repeat these steps for every app that you want to expose.


### Step 2: Map your custom domain and select TLS termination
{: #private_2}

When you configure the private ALB, you use a custom domain that your apps will be accessible through and choose whether to use TLS termination.
{: shortdesc}

The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to your apps. To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to you can use your own TLS certificate to decrypt the network traffic. The ALB then forwards the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster.
1.   Create a custom domain. To register your custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider or [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} DNS](/docs/infrastructure/dns/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-dns).
      * If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`.

2. Map your custom domain to the portable private IP address of the IBM-provided private ALB by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable private IP address of the private ALB, run `ibmcloud ks albs --cluster <cluster_name>`.
3.   Optional: To use TLS, either import or create a TLS certificate and key secret. If you use a wildcard domain, ensure that you import or create a wildcard certificate in the <code>default</code> namespace so that the ALB can access and use the certificate in each namespace.
      * If a TLS certificate is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:
        ```
        ibmcloud ks alb-cert-deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
        ```
        {: pre}
      * If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
        1. Create a TLS certificate and key for your domain that is encoded in PEM format.
        2. Create a secret that uses your TLS certificate and key. Replace <em>&lt;tls_secret_name&gt;</em> with a name for your Kubernetes secret, <em>&lt;tls_key_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS key file, and <em>&lt;tls_cert_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS certificate file.
          ```
          kubectl create secret tls <tls_secret_name> --key=<tls_key_filepath> --cert=<tls_cert_filepath>
          ```
          {: pre}


### Step 3: Create the Ingress resource
{: #pivate_3}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

**Note:** If your cluster has multiple namespaces where apps are exposed, at least one Ingress resource is required per namespace. However, each namespace must use a different host. You must register a wildcard domain and specify a different subdomain in each resource. For more information, see [Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces](#multiple_namespaces).

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingressresource.yaml`.

2.  Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
      annotations:
        ingress.bluemix.net/ALB-ID: "<private_ALB_ID>"
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example YAML that uses TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
      annotations:
        ingress.bluemix.net/ALB-ID: "<private_ALB_ID>"
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <tls_secret_name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    <td><code>servicePort</code></td>
    <td>The port that your service listens to. Use the same port that you defined when you created the Kubernetes service for your app.</td>
    </tr>

3.  Create the Ingress resource for your cluster. Ensure that the resource deploys into the same namespace as the app services that you specified in the resource.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f myingressresource.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}
4.   Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully.

      ```
      kubectl describe ingress myingressresource
      ```
      {: pre}

      1. If messages in the events describe an error in your resource configuration, change the values in your resource file and reapply the file for the resource.


Your Ingress resource is created in the same namespace as your app services. Your apps in this namespace are registered with the cluster's Ingress ALB.

### Step 4: Access your app from your private network
{: #private_4}

1. Before you can access your app, make sure that you can access a DNS service.
  * Public and private VLAN: To use the default external DNS provider, you must [configure edge nodes with public access](cs_edge.html#edge) and [configure a Virtual Router Appliance ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/07/kubernetes-and-bluemix-container-based-workloads-part4/).
  * Private VLAN only: You must configure a [DNS service that is available on the private network ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/).

2. From within your private network firewall, enter the URL of the app service in a web browser.

```
https://<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

If you exposed multiple apps, access those apps by changing the path that is appended to the URL.

```
https://<domain>/<app2_path>
```
{: pre}

If you use a wildcard domain to expose apps in different namespaces, access those apps with their respective subdomains.

```
http://<subdomain1>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

```
http://<subdomain2>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

## Customizing an Ingress resource with annotations
{: #annotations}

To add capabilities to your Ingress application load balancer (ALB), you can add IBM-specific annotations as metadata in an Ingress resource.
{: shortdesc}

Get started with some of the most commonly used annotations.
* [redirect-to-https](cs_annotations.html#redirect-to-https): Convert insecure HTTP client requests to HTTPS.
* [rewrite-path](cs_annotations.html#rewrite-path): Route incoming network traffic to a different path that your backend app listens on.
* [ssl-services](cs_annotations.html#ssl-services): Use TLS to encrypt traffic to your upstream apps that require HTTPS.
* [client-max-body-size](cs_annotations.html#client-max-body-size): Set the maximum size of the body that the client can send as part of a request.

For the full list of supported annotations, see [Customizing Ingress with annotations](cs_annotations.html).

<br />


## Opening ports in the Ingress ALB
{: #opening_ingress_ports}

By default, only ports 80 and 443 are exposed in the Ingress ALB. To expose other ports, you can edit the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.
{:shortdesc}

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Add a <code>data</code> section and specify public ports `80`, `443`, and any other ports you want to expose separated by a semi-colon (;).

    **Important**: By default, ports 80 and 443 are open. If you want to keep 80 and 443 open, you must also include them in addition to any other ports you specify in the `public-ports` field. Any port that is not specified is closed. If you enabled a private ALB, you must also specify any ports that you want to keep open in the `private-ports` field.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      public-ports: "80;443;<port3>"
      private-ports: "80;443;<port4>"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example that keeps ports `80`, `443`, and `9443` open:
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      public-ports: "80;443;9443"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied.

 ```
 kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
 ```
 {: pre}

For more information about configmap resources, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/).

<br />


## Preserving the source IP address
{: #preserve_source_ip}

By default, the source IP address of the client request is not preserved. When a client request to your app is sent to your cluster, the request is routed to a pod for the load balancer service that exposes the ALB. If no app pod exists on the same worker node as the load balancer service pod, the load balancer forwards the request to an app pod on a different worker node. The source IP address of the package is changed to the public IP address of the worker node where the app pod is running.

To preserve the original source IP address of the client request, you can [enable source IP preservation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/#source-ip-for-services-with-typeloadbalancer). Preserving the client’s IP is useful, for example, when app servers have to apply security and access-control policies.

**Note**: If you [disable an ALB](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_alb_configure), any source IP changes you make to the load balancer service exposing the ALB are lost. When you re-enable the ALB, you must enable source IP again.

To enable source IP preservation, edit the load balancer service that exposes an Ingress ALB:

1. Enable source IP preservation for a single ALB or for all the ALBs in your cluster.
    * To set up source IP preservation for a single ALB:
        1. Get the ID of the ALB for which you want to enable source IP. The ALB services have a format similar to `public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1` for a public ALB or `private-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1` for a private ALB.
            ```
            kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb
            ```
            {: pre}

        2. Open the YAML for the load balancer service that exposes the ALB.
            ```
            kubectl edit svc <ALB_ID> -n kube-system
            ```
            {: pre}

        3. Under **spec**, change the value of **externalTrafficPolicy** from `Cluster` to `Local`.

        4. Save and close the configuration file. The output is similar to the following:

            ```
            service "public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1" edited
            ```
            {: screen}
    * To set up source IP preservation for all public ALBs in your cluster, run the following command:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^public" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Local"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        "public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1", "public-cr17e61e63c6e94b658596ca92d087eed9-alb2" patched
        ```
        {: screen}

    * To set up source IP preservation for all private ALBs in your cluster, run the following command:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^private" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Local"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        "private-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1", "private-cr17e61e63c6e94b658596ca92d087eed9-alb2" patched
        ```
        {: screen}

2. Verify that the source IP is being preserved in your ALB pods logs.
    1. Get the ID of a pod for the ALB that you modified.
        ```
        kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep alb
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Open the logs for that ALB pod. Verify that the IP address for the `client` field is the client request IP address instead of the load balancer service IP address.
        ```
        kubectl logs <ALB_pod_ID> nginx-ingress -n kube-system
        ```
        {: pre}

3. Now, when you look up the headers for the requests sent to your backend app, you can see the client IP address in the `x-forwarded-for` header.

4. If you no longer want to preserve the source IP, you can revert the changes you made to the service.
    * To revert source IP preservation for your public ALBs:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^public" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}
    * To revert source IP preservation for your private ALBs:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^private" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}

## Configuring SSL protocols and SSL ciphers at the HTTP level
{: #ssl_protocols_ciphers}

Enable SSL protocols and ciphers at the global HTTP level by editing the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap.
{:shortdesc}

By default, the TLS 1.2 protocol is used for all Ingress configurations that use the IBM-provided domain. You can override the default to instead use TLS 1.1 or 1.0 protocols by following these steps.

**Note**: When you specify the enabled protocols for all hosts, the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 parameters (1.1.13, 1.0.12) work only when OpenSSL 1.0.1 or higher is used. The TLSv1.3 parameter (1.13.0) works only when OpenSSL 1.1.1 built with TLSv1.3 support is used.

To edit the configmap to enable SSL protocols and ciphers:

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Add the SSL protocols and ciphers. Format ciphers according to the [OpenSSL library cipher list format ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/apps/ciphers.html).

   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     ssl-protocols: "TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2"
     ssl-ciphers: "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5"
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
     namespace: kube-system
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

## Tuning performance
{: #perf_tuning}

To optimize performance of your Ingress ALBs, you can change the default settings according to your needs.
{: shortdesc}



### Increasing the keepalive connection time
{: #keepalive_time}

Keepalive connections can have a major impact on performance by reducing the CPU and network overhead needed to open and close connections. To optimize performance of your ALBs, you can change the default setting of the keepalive time for the connections between the ALB and the client.
{: shortdesc}

In the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` Ingress configmap, the `keep-alive` field sets the timeout, in seconds, during which the keepalive client connection stays open to the Ingress ALB. By default, `keep-alive` is set to `8s`. You can override the default by editing the Ingress configmap.

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Change the value of `keep-alive` from `8s` to a larger value.

   ```

## Configuring a user-managed Ingress controller
{: #user_managed}

Run your own Ingress controller on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} while leveraging the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain and TLS certificate assigned to your cluster.
{: shortdesc}

Configuring your own custom Ingress controller can be useful when you have specific Ingress requirements. When you run your own Ingress controller instead of the IBM-provided Ingress ALB, you are responsible for supplying the controller image, maintaining the controller, and updating the controller.

1. Get the ID of the default public ALB. The public ALB has a format similar to `public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1`.
    ```
    kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Disable the default public ALB. The `--disable-deployment` flag disables the IBM-provided ALB deployment, but doesn't remove the DNS registration for the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain or the load balancer service that is used to expose the Ingress controller.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb-configure --alb-ID <ALB_ID> --disable-deployment
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Get the configuration file for your Ingress controller ready. For example, you can use the YAML configuration file for the [nginx community Ingress controller ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/deploy/mandatory.yaml).

4. Deploy your own Ingress controller. **Important**: To continue to use the load balancer service exposing the controller and the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain, your controller must be deployed in the `kube-system` namespace.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f customingress.yaml -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Get the label on your custom Ingress deployment.
    ```
    kubectl get deploy nginx-ingress-controller -n kube-system --show-labels
    ```
    {: pre}

    In the following example output, the label value is `ingress-nginx`:
    ```
    NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE       LABELS
    nginx-ingress-controller   1         1         1            1           1m        app=ingress-nginx
    ```
    {: screen}

5. Using the ALB ID you got in step 1, open the load balancer service that exposes the ALB.
    ```
    kubectl edit svc <ALB_ID> -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

6. Update the load balancer service to point to your custom Ingress deployment. Under `spec/selector`, remove the ALB ID from the `app` label and add the label for your own Ingress controller that you got in step 5.
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      ...
    spec:
      clusterIP: 172.21.xxx.xxx
      externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
      loadBalancerIP: 169.xx.xxx.xxx
      ports:
      - name: http
        nodePort: 31070
        port: 80
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 80
      - name: https
        nodePort: 31854
        port: 443
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 443
      selector:
        app: <custom_controller_label>
      ...
    ```
    {: codeblock}
    1. Optional: By default, the load balancer service allows traffic on port 80 and 443. If your custom Ingress controller requires a different set of ports, add those ports to the `ports` section.

7. Save and close the configuration file. The output is similar to the following:
    ```
    service "public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1" edited
    ```
    {: screen}

8. Verify that the ALB `Selector` now points to your controller.
    ```
    kubectl describe svc <ALB_ID> -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    Name:                     public-cre58bff97659a4f41bc927362d5a8ee7a-alb1
    Namespace:                kube-system
    Labels:                   app=public-cre58bff97659a4f41bc927362d5a8ee7a-alb1
    Annotations:              service.kubernetes.io/ibm-ingress-controller-public=169.xx.xxx.xxx
                              service.kubernetes.io/ibm-load-balancer-cloud-provider-zone=wdc07
    Selector:                 app=ingress-nginx
    Type:                     LoadBalancer
    IP:                       172.21.xxx.xxx
    IP:                       169.xx.xxx.xxx
    LoadBalancer Ingress:     169.xx.xxx.xxx
    Port:                     port-443  443/TCP
    TargetPort:               443/TCP
    NodePort:                 port-443  30087/TCP
    Endpoints:                172.30.xxx.xxx:443
    Port:                     port-80  80/TCP
    TargetPort:               80/TCP
    NodePort:                 port-80  31865/TCP
    Endpoints:                172.30.xxx.xxx:80
    Session Affinity:         None
    External Traffic Policy:  Cluster
    Events:                   <none>
    ```
    {: screen}

8. Deploy any other resources that are required by your custom Ingress controller, such as the configmap.

9. If you have a multizone cluster, repeat these steps for each ALB.

10. Create Ingress resources for your apps by following the steps in [Exposing apps that are inside your cluster to the public](#ingress_expose_public).

Your apps are now exposed by your custom Ingress controller. To restore the IBM-provided ALB deployment, re-enable the ALB. The ALB is redeployed, and the load balancer service is automatically reconfigured to point to the ALB.

```
ibmcloud ks alb-configure --alb-ID <alb ID> --enable
```
