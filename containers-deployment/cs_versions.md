# Version information and update actions
{: #cs_versions}

## Kubernetes version types
{: #version_types}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} concurrently supports multiple versions of Kubernetes. When a latest version (n) is released, versions up to 2 behind (n-2) are supported. Versions more than 2 behind the latest (n-3) are first deprecated and then unsupported.
{:shortdesc}

**Supported Kubernetes versions**:

- Latest: 1.10.5
- Default: 1.10.5
- Other: 1.9.9, 1.8.15

</br>

**Deprecated versions**: When clusters are running on a deprecated Kubernetes version, you have 30 days to review and update to a supported Kubernetes version before the version becomes unsupported. During the deprecation period, your cluster is still fully supported. However, you cannot create new clusters that use the deprecated version.

**Unsupported versions**: If you are running clusters on a Kubernetes version that is not supported, [review potential impacts](#version_types) for updates and then immediately [update the cluster](cs_cluster_update.html#update) to continue receiving important security updates and support. 
*  **Attention**: If you wait until your cluster is three or more minor versions behind a supported version, you must force the update, which might cause unexpected results or failure. 
*  Unsupported clusters cannot add or reload existing worker nodes. 
*  After you update the cluster to a supported version, your cluster can resume normal operations and continue receiving support.

</br>

To check the server version of a cluster, run the following command.

```
kubectl version  --short | grep -i server
```
{: pre}

Example output:

```
Server Version: v1.10.5+IKS
```
{: screen}


## Update types
{: #update_types}

Your Kubernetes cluster has three types of updates: major, minor, and patch.
{:shortdesc}

|Update type|Examples of version labels|Updated by|Impact
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Major|1.x.x|You|Operation changes for clusters, including scripts or deployments.|
|Minor|x.9.x|You|Operation changes for clusters, including scripts or deployments.|
|Patch|x.x.4_1510|IBM and you|Kubernetes patches, as well as other {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Provider component updates such as security and operating system patches. IBM updates masters automatically, but you apply patches to worker nodes.|
{: caption="Impacts of Kubernetes updates" caption-side="top"}

As updates become available, you are notified when you view information about the worker nodes, such as with the `ibmcloud ks workers <cluster>` or `ibmcloud ks worker-get <cluster> <worker>` commands.
-  **Major and minor updates**: First, [update your master node](cs_cluster_update.html#master) and then [update the worker nodes](cs_cluster_update.html#worker_node).
   - By default, you cannot update a Kubernetes master three or more minor versions ahead. For example, if your current master is version 1.5 and you want to update to 1.8, you must update to 1.7 first. You can force the update to continue, but updating more than two minor versions might cause unexpected results or failure.
   - If you use a `kubectl` CLI version that does match at least the `major.minor` version of your clusters, you might experience unexpected results. Make sure to keep your Kubernetes cluster and [CLI versions](cs_cli_install.html#kubectl) up-to-date.
-  **Patch updates**: Check monthly to see whether an update is available, and use the `ibmcloud ks worker-update` [command](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_worker_update) or the `ibmcloud ks worker-reload` [command](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_worker_reload) to apply these security and operating system patches. For more information, see [Version changelog](cs_versions_changelog.html).

<br/>

This information summarizes updates that are likely to have impact on deployed apps when you update a cluster to a new version from the previous version.

However, this does <strong>not</strong> impact the ability to access the dashboard from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console or by using <code>kubectl proxy</code>. If a pod requires access to the dashboard, you can add a <code>kubernetes-dashboard-policy: allow</code> label to a namespace and then deploy the pod to the namespace.</td>

<td>Kubelet API access</td>
<td>Kubelet API authorization is now delegated to the <code>Kubernetes API server</code>.

### Preparing to update to Calico v3
{: #110_calicov3}

Before you begin, your cluster master and all worker nodes must be running Kubernetes version 1.8 or later, and must have at least one worker node.

**Important**: Prepare for the Calico v3 update before you update the master. During the master upgrade to Kubernetes v1.10, new pods and new Kubernetes or Calico network policies are not scheduled. The amount of time that the update prevents new scheduling varies. Small clusters can take a few minutes, with a few extra minutes for every 10 nodes. Existing network policies and pods continue to run.

1.  Verify that your Calico pods are healthy.
    ```
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node -o wide
    ```
    {: pre}

2.  If any pod is not in a **Running** state, delete the pod and wait until it is in a **Running** state before you continue.

3.  If you auto-generate Calico policies or other Calico resources, update your automation tooling to generate these resources with [Calico v3 syntax ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/reference/calicoctl/resources/).

4.  If you use [strongSwan](cs_vpn.html#vpn-setup) for VPN connectivity, the strongSwan 2.0.0 Helm chart does not work with Calico v3 or Kubernetes 1.10. [Update strongSwan](cs_vpn.html#vpn_upgrade) to the 2.1.0 Helm chart, which is backward compatible with Calico 2.6, and Kubernetes 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9.

5.  [Update your cluster master to Kubernetes v1.10](cs_cluster_update.html#master).

<br />


## Version 1.9
{: #cs_v19}

<p><img src="images/certified_kubernetes_1x9.png" style="padding-right: 10px;" align="left" alt="This badge indicates Kubernetes version 1.9 certification for IBM Cloud Container Service."/> {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} is a Certified Kubernetes product for version 1.9 under the CNCF Kubernetes Software Conformance Certification program. _KubernetesÂ® is a registered trademark of The Linux Foundation in the United States and other countries, and is used pursuant to a license from The Linux Foundation._</p>

<code>kubectl get pods -n &lt;namespace&gt; -o yaml | grep "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable" && echo "Action required"</code></li></ul><br>
