# Debugging your cluster
{: #cs_troubleshoot}

As you use {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}, consider these techniques for general troubleshooting and debugging your clusters. You can also check the [status of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} system ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/support/#status).
{: shortdesc}

You can take these general steps to ensure that your clusters are up-to-date:
- Check monthly for available security and operating system patches to [update your worker nodes](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_worker_update).
- [Update your cluster](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_cluster_update) to the latest default [version of Kubernetes](cs_versions.html) for {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}

## Debugging clusters
{: #debug_clusters}

Review the options to debug your clusters and find the root causes for failures.

1.  List your cluster and find the `State` of the cluster.

  ```
  ibmcloud ks clusters
  ```
  {: pre}

2.  Review the `State` of your cluster. If your cluster is in a **Critical**, **Delete failed**, or **Warning** state, or is stuck in the **Pending** state for a long time, start [debugging the worker nodes](#debug_worker_nodes).

## Debugging worker nodes
{: #debug_worker_nodes}

Review the options to debug your worker nodes and find the root causes for failures.


1.  If your cluster is in a **Critical**, **Delete failed**, or **Warning** state, or is stuck in the **Pending** state for a long time, review the state of your worker nodes.

  ```
  ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_id>
  ```
  {: pre}

2.  Review the `State` and `Status` field for every worker node in your CLI output.

  <table summary="Every table row should be read left to right, with the cluster state in column one and a description in column two.">
  <caption>Worker node states</caption>
    <thead>
    <th>Worker node state</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
  <tr>
      <td>Critical</td>
      <td>A worker node can go into a Critical state for many reasons: <ul><li>You initiated a reboot for your worker node without cordoning and draining your worker node. Rebooting a worker node can cause data corruption in <code>docker</code>, <code>kubelet</code>, <code>kube-proxy</code>, and <code>calico</code>. </li><li>The pods that are deployed to your worker node do not use resource limits for [memory ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/) and [CPU ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/). Without resource limits, pods can consume all available resources, leaving no resources for other pods to run on this worker node. This overcommitment of workload causes the worker node to fail. </li><li><code>Docker</code>, <code>kubelet</code>, or <code>calico</code> went into an unrecoverable state after it ran hundreds or thousands of containers over time. </li><li>You set up a Virtual Router Appliance for your worker node that went down and cut off the communication between your worker node and the Kubernetes master. </li><li> Current networking issues in {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} or IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) that causes the communication between your worker node and the Kubernetes master to fail.</li><li>Your worker node ran out of capacity. Check the <strong>Status</strong> of the worker node to see whether it shows <strong>Out of disk</strong> or <strong>Out of memory</strong>. If your worker node is out of capacity, consider to either reduce the workload on your worker node or add a worker node to your cluster to help load balance the workload.</li></ul> In many cases, [reloading](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_worker_reload) your worker node can solve the problem. When you reload your worker node, the latest [patch version](cs_versions.html#version_types) is applied to your worker node. The major and minor version is not changed. Before you reload your worker node, make sure to cordon and drain your worker node to ensure that the existing pods are terminated gracefully and rescheduled onto remaining worker nodes. </br></br> If reloading the worker node does not resolve the issue, go to the next step to continue troubleshooting your worker node. </br></br><strong>Tip:</strong> You can [configure health checks for your worker node and enable Autorecovery](cs_health.html#autorecovery). If Autorecovery detects an unhealthy worker node based on the configured checks, Autorecovery triggers a corrective action like an OS reload on the worker node. For more information about how Autorecovery works, see the [Autorecovery blog ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/12/autorecovery-utilizes-consistent-hashing-high-availability/).

## Debugging app deployments
{: #debug_apps}

Review the options that you have to debug your app deployments and find the root causes for failures.

1. Look for abnormalities in the service or deployment resources by running the `describe` command.

 Example:
 <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl describe service &lt;service_name&gt; </code></pre>

2. [Check whether the containers are stuck in the ContainerCreating state](cs_troubleshoot_storage.html#stuck_creating_state).

3. Check whether the cluster is in the `Critical` state. If the cluster is in a `Critical` state, check the firewall rules and verify that the master can communicate with the worker nodes.

4. Verify that the service is listening on the correct port.
   1. Get the name of a pod.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl get pods</code></pre>
   2. Log in to a container.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl exec -it &lt;pod_name&gt; -- /bin/bash</code></pre>
   3. Curl the app from within the container. If the port is not accessible, the service might not be listening on the correct port or the app might have issues. Update the configuration file for the service with the correct port and redeploy or investigate potential issues with the app.
     <pre class="pre"><code>curl localhost: &lt;port&gt;</code></pre>

5. Verify that the service is linked correctly to the pods.
   1. Get the name of a pod.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl get pods</code></pre>
   2. Log in to a container.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl exec -it &lt;pod_name&gt; -- /bin/bash</code></pre>
   3. Curl the cluster IP address and port of the service. If the IP address and port are not accessible, look at the endpoints for the service. If no endpoints are listed, then the selector for the service does not match the pods. If endpoints are listed, then look at the target port field on the service and make sure that the target port is the same as what is being used for the pods.
     <pre class="pre"><code>curl &lt;cluster_IP&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code></pre>

6. For Ingress services, verify that the service is accessible from within the cluster.
   1. Get the name of a pod.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl get pods</code></pre>
   2. Log in to a container.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl exec -it &lt;pod_name&gt; -- /bin/bash</code></pre>
   2. Curl the URL specified for the Ingress service. If the URL is not accessible, check for a firewall issue between the cluster and the external endpoint. 
     <pre class="pre"><code>curl &lt;host_name&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;</code></pre>

<br />
